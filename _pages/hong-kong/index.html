      <p>The shining epicentre of Hong Kong business, Central is an awe-inspiring marvel of glistening towers and fierce modernity.</p>

You’ll find luxury shopping to fill your days, framed by glass and steel monoliths. Take the Mid-Levels Escalator and alight at SoHo. This artsy neighbourhood is the playground of Central’s bon vivants, where narrow streets shelter nascent galleries, smart boutiques, cool bars and renowned eateries.

      <p>Head for the famous Sogo and Times Square Mall to start.

To accommodate the crowds, cafes and eateries dot the area, particularly along the aptly named Food Street. If it all becomes a little much, head for Victoria Park, the largest in the city. For a truly tranquil spot, don’t miss the Tin Hau Temple gardens.</p>
